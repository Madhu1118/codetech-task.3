AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP)



This project aims to build an intelligent AI chatbot that can answer user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is developed using Python and popular NLP libraries such as NLTK and spaCy. The system processes the user's input, interprets the meaning, and provides appropriate responses. The chatbot is designed to handle a variety of conversational topics, making it a versatile tool for engaging with users.

Features

Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes NLTK or spaCy for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

Response Generation: Implements basic algorithms to generate dynamic responses based on the user's query.

User Interaction: Chatbot interacts with the user in a conversational style.

Customizable: Easily extendable to add more features like intent classification or integration with external APIs.


Deliverables

Python Script: Full working code for the chatbot, with NLP processing functions.

Running Chatbot: A fully functional chatbot capable of processing user input and providing real-time responses.

Documentation: Clear instructions for setting up and running the chatbot.
